- Why We Learn About Systematic Program Design?
  1. When programming, we're often faced with a poorly defined problem. The first step in systematic design is figuring out exactly what we want our program to accomplish. This initial phase is crucial because a lack of clarity here will lead to a poorly structured program.
  1. A single program can often be too large to solve all at once. Therefore, a core principle of systematic design is to break the problem down into **well-chosen, smaller, and more manageable pieces**. By writing code for each of these individual components, we ensure that they fit together seamlessly and are thoroughly tested.
